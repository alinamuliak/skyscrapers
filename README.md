# skyscrapers
First task of first lab.

Skyscrapers is a logical game in the placement of houses. In this game you need to place houses of different heights on the game board so that the number of visible houses from a certain position (the number with the arrow is a hint) was equal to the number in the hint. The arrow in the tooltip indicates the direction in which you want to look.

A set of features has been developed to check whether there is a winning combination on the game board. The winning combination is a combination that satisfies all the rules for placing skyscrapers on the game board.
